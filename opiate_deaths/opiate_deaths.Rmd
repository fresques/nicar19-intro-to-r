```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

#Echo=TRUE means your code will be displayed on the HTML page
#change that to echo=FALSE to hide the code and only display results

```
## How to run code
To run a single line of code, there are a many options. The first is to have your cursor on the code and hit Control-Enter at the same time. The second is to highlight that line of code (or a bunch of lines) and go to the Run button (up top, near the Insert button) and choose "Run selected lines". Another is to run an entire "chunk" at the same time (everything between the ```{r} and the ```) by clicking Control-Shift-Enter while your cursor is anywhere inside the chunk.



## Load packages

```{r}
#install.package("reader")

library(readr) #importing csv files 
library(dplyr) #general analysis 
library(ggplot2) #for making charts 
library(ggthemes) #this will help make our charts look better
library(janitor) #for data cleanup
library(lubridate) #for working with dates

#we'll need these new packages for creating this markdown page to an HTMl page
library(rmarkdown)
library(knitr)
```


## Import data
```{r}
#Death records for opioid-related deaths

#first we'll set the name of our new data frame
#then we'll use the read_csv, which is part of the readr package
#and we'll tell it where to find csv file

deaths <- read_csv('./data/opiate_deaths.csv')
```


## Review data
<p>There are a bunch of ways to make sure your data came in the way you wanted. The one that is probably most similar to what you're used to is to go to the Environment tab (in upper right corner) and double-click on the opiatedata data frame. It will pop it open in a new window -- showing you some (but not all) of the rows, plus all the columns. This is a way to eyeball what it looks like.</p>
<p>You can also run some R commands, such as these below:</p>

```{r}

#this shows us the top few rows of the file
head(deaths)

#you can also just type the name of your data frame and it will make it appear below
deaths


#this shows us the column names
names(deaths)


#this shows us the structure (column formats, etc)
str(deaths)


#look to see the columns are formatted the way you want 
#(dates are date formats, numbers are numeric, etc)

#notice that all the date fields came in as characters (not what we want!)
#birthdate
#deathdate
#injury_date



```


```{r}
#Let's go back and add some details to the import code
#the col_types function allows you to set formats for specific fields
#in this case, I also told it the default should be character
#for any fields that I don't specify
#here, we need to tell R how the dates in our underlying data are structured
#more info about date formats using readr here: https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/parse_datetime.html


#copy this code and replace the original import code at the top of the page
deaths <- read_csv('./data/opiate_deaths.csv',
                   col_types=cols(.default="c", BIRTHDATE=col_date("%m/%d/%Y"),
                                  DEATHDATE=col_date("%m/%d/%Y"),
                                  AGEYEARS=col_integer(),
                                  INJURY_DATE=col_date("%m/%d/%Y")))

```

# Analysis
One of the packages within Tidyverse is called "dplyr" and it works very much like Structured Query Language (SQL) and allows you to filter, sort and summarize your data (like in a Pivot Table).


## Select
```{r}
#We can use the SELECT command to return only certain columns (but all the rows)
deaths %>%  select(LASTNAME, FIRSTNAME, DEATHDATE, AGEYEARS)
```

## Try using SELECT on your own

```{r}
#Create your own query showing LASTNAME, RACE, GENDER


```

## Filtering
```{r}
# a single filter
# note that it needs two equal signs

deaths %>%   filter(GENDER=="F") %>% select(LASTNAME, DEATHDATE, GENDER, RACE)


#put quotes around character values
# no quotes for numeric. ( i.e. AGEYEARS== 20  )


```

```{r}
#Find people who died on New Year's Eve, 2015
#Note how dates are stored in R

deaths %>%  filter(DEATHDATE=='2015-12-31')
```



## Your turn - practice filtering

```{r}
# Find people who died in (DEATHCOUNTY) "HENNEPIN" county.

```


## Indenting code
When you start to get a lot of code, you might want to use indentation to make it cleaner to read. In the examples below, notice that the pipe (%>%) is always at the end of a line, not the beginning, and each piece of code is on its own line.



# More filtering
## Filtering with "and"

```{r}
# find black women who died

deaths %>%   filter(GENDER=="F", RACE=="BLACK") %>% select(LASTNAME, DEATHDATE, GENDER, RACE)
```


## Filtering with "or"

```{r}
# find people who were either Black or American Indian

#option 1 using the pipe character
deaths%>%
  filter(RACE=="BLACK" | RACE=="AMERICAN INDIAN") %>%
  select(LASTNAME, DEATHDATE, GENDER, RACE)

#option 2 using %in%  (this one would be more useful if you have a long series you want to include)
deaths%>%
  filter(RACE %in% c("BLACK", "AMERICAN INDIAN", "CHINESE")) %>%
  select(LASTNAME, DEATHDATE, GENDER, RACE)
```





# Summarizing data
a.k.a. Pivot Tables or group by queries

```{r}
# Number of deaths by gender

deaths%>%
  group_by(GENDER)%>%
  summarize(numdeaths=n())
```

## Arrange (order by/sort)
```{r}

#descending by number of deaths
deaths %>% 
  group_by(GENDER) %>% 
  summarise(numdeaths=n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(numdeaths))

#ascending by gender
deaths %>% 
  group_by(GENDER) %>% 
  summarise(numdeaths=n()) %>% 
  arrange(GENDER)
```


## Your turn - summarize
```{r}
#Number of deaths by race, ordered from highest to lowest


```



```{r}
# Number of deaths by county (DEATHCOUNTY), highest to lowest


```


#Filter, summarize, arrange

```{r}
#let's put a bunch of things together
#How many women died in each county, sorted highest to lowest?

deaths %>% 
  filter(GENDER=='F') %>% 
  group_by(DEATHCOUNTY) %>% 
  summarize(count=n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(count))



```


##Add a percentage

```{r}
#What percentage of deaths were women?

deaths %>% 
  group_by(GENDER) %>% 
  summarise(numdeaths=n()) %>% 
  mutate(percent=numdeaths/sum(numdeaths)) 

```

```{r}
#Let's make that look better
deaths %>% 
  group_by(GENDER) %>% 
  summarise(numdeaths=n()) %>% 
   mutate(percent=(numdeaths/sum(numdeaths)*100)) %>% 
  mutate(percent=round(percent, digits=1)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(percent))

```




# Intro to date functions

```{r}
# Our data doesn't include a field indicating the year that each person died. It only has the full death date. In order to group by and summarize by the year, we need to extract the year from the deathdate. We can do this on the fly in a query. Or add it as a new field to the table

#we'll use the year() function from the lubridate package
#make sure we loaded that library at the top of the page
#library(lubridate)

#on the fly query

deaths %>% group_by(year(DEATHDATE)) %>% summarize(count=n())
```

# Add a new column
```{r}
#We can use mutate() function from tidyverse to add a new column to our data frame

#note that we overwrite our existing data frame

deaths <- deaths %>% 
  mutate(DEATHYR = year(DEATHDATE))


```


# Make a new data frame


```{r}
# Let's make that last query (using our new year field) into its own data frame
#so we can then use it as the basis for a chart

deaths_by_year <-  deaths %>%
  group_by(DEATHYR) %>% 
  summarize(numdeaths=n())



```


# Making charts

##The basics for a bar chart
```{r chart1}

deaths_by_year_chart <-   #create a new data frame
  ggplot(deaths_by_year, aes(x = DEATHYR, y = numdeaths)) +   #this line tells it what data to chart
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")  #this line tells it to make a bar chart


plot(deaths_by_year_chart)  #this generates the plot
```



##Add some styling
Let's start by setting the factor order of the deathyr field so that it plots in the correct order and displays the labels correctly.



```{r}
deaths_by_year$DEATHYR <-  factor(deaths_by_year$DEATHYR, levels=deaths_by_year$DEATHYR[order(deaths_by_year$DEATHYR)])
```


Then we'll add a title and some labels. There are a variety of ways to do this. Here's my favorite:


```{r chart2}

#Build the chart again, this time with labels and titles
deaths_by_year_chart <- 
  ggplot(deaths_by_year, aes(x = DEATHYR, y = numdeaths)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
    labs(title = "Number of opiate deaths by year in Minnesota", 
       subtitle = "2006-2015",
       caption = "Graphic by MaryJo Webster",
       x="Year",
       y="Number of deaths")

plot(deaths_by_year_chart)
```

Add color:

Notice in the geom_bar line (in chart below) I've added "color="black" (this is for the outline of the bars) and fill="#006699" (this is for the fill color). This is a hex color code. You can go to colorbrewer.org to find all kinds of great color options that are color-blind safe. You could also put that same hex code in the color spot so that it's all one color and essentially doesn't have a border. More hex color codes are here http://www.color-hex.com/

```{r chart3}

deaths_by_year_chart_2 <- ggplot(deaths_by_year, aes(x = DEATHYR, y = numdeaths)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", color="black", fill="#006699") +
  labs(title = "Number of opiate deaths by year in Minnesota", 
       subtitle = "2006-2015",
       caption = "Graphic by MaryJo Webster",
       x="Year",
       y="Number of deaths")

plot(deaths_by_year_chart_2)

```



Add value labels & a theme

I'd like to display the number of deaths at the end of each bar. To do that we'll use geom_text(). This one gets a bit more complicated. 

We're adding a new line called geom_text. We tell it where to get the label (from the numdeaths column) and then you have some options for the size of the text (size) and placement (hjust and position)

I've also added:  theme_hc() +

This tells it to give it a different look using a "theme" based on High Charts. It gets rid of the grey background. There are a variety of great themes you can access using the ggthemes library.


```{r chart6}

deaths_by_year_chart_2 <- ggplot(deaths_by_year, aes(x = DEATHYR, y = numdeaths)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", color="#006699", fill="#006699") +
    geom_text(stat="identity", label=paste0((deaths_by_year$numdeaths)), vjust=1.5)+
    theme_hc()+  #this uses the "High Charts" theme
    labs(title = "Number of opiate deaths by year in Minnesota", 
       subtitle = "2006-2015",
       caption = "Graphic by MaryJo Webster",
       x="Year",
       y="Number of deaths")

plot(deaths_by_year_chart_2)
```



#Export our chart
```{r}
#https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggsave.html

ggsave("deaths_by_year_chart.jpg", width=8, height=5, units="in", dpi="print")
```



## Make your own bar chart

```{r}
#Create a new data frame totaling the deaths by gender



#Create a data frame plotting those totals (hint: x=gender)


#plot the data frame


```



# Cleaning data

```{r}
# let's look at this field to see where we've got a problem
deaths %>% group_by(HISPANICETHNICITY) %>% summarise(count=n())
```

#Recode values into a new column
```{r}
#we'll use a lot of the same things we did above
#plus a base R function called "case_when" (it's like an IF statement)

deaths <-  deaths %>%
  mutate(hispanic_new = 
           case_when(HISPANICETHNICITY=='Non-Hispanic' | 
HISPANICETHNICITY=='NOT HISPANIC' ~'NOT HISPANIC',
TRUE~toupper(HISPANICETHNICITY)))

# the base R function called "toupper()" converts values to uppercase


#let's see our new column

deaths %>% 
  group_by(hispanic_new) %>% 
  summarise(numdeaths = n())

```







# More advanced filtering
##Filtering with a wildcard
<p>Too often, our data is inconsistent and telling it to find one thing will be insufficient. In filters in Excel, we have the option to choose "begins with" or "contains" to find values that might not perfectly match. In this dataset, there are several variations for people described as being white. To get them, we'll need this kind of wildcard.</p>
<p>To do this, we're going to use dplyr's filter function, along with Base R's grepl, which is a way to do string and pattern matching.</p>
<p>So that you can see that you really did get back lots of variations of "white", I changed up the code so that it summarizes the results (a Pivot Table, in other words). We'll be explaining that next.</p>

```{r query5}
#the syntax for grepl is to put the word you're looking for in quotes, followed by the name of the column where you want it to look
  deaths %>%
  filter(grepl("WHITE", RACE)) %>%
  group_by(RACE) %>%
  summarize(count=n()) 
```

##Filtering between two values
<p>Perhaps we want to find all the people who were between ages 18 and 21. Note that I'm using greater than-equal to and less than-equal to, so that it includes 18 and 21 in my results.</p>

```{r query6}
deaths %>%
  filter(AGEYEARS>=18, AGEYEARS<=21) %>%
  group_by(AGEYEARS) %>%
  summarise(count=n()) 
```
