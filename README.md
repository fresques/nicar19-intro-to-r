# Intro to R
## NICAR 2019 -- Thursday, March 7, 2019 2:15 p.m. – 5:45 p.m.

Skill level: Intermediate

This class will introduce you to R, a free, powerful open-source programming language, that will add statistical heft to your reporting. By the end of this three-hour session, you will be able to take raw data, import it into R, and start your analysis. Topics will include basic data importing, working with directories, reading in data, installing packages, creating simple visualizations, and how to clean, explore and sort your data. We’ll also talk about how to find help when you’re stuck.

Preregistration is required and seating is limited. Laptops will be provided for the training.

Workshop prerequisites: This session will be most helpful if you’re comfortable working with data in spreadsheets or SQL and you’re ready to take your skills to the next level.
